Cardiovascular disease is now a  leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors as they are  living long enough to experience later onset cardiac effects of these treatments.&nbsp;Cardio-oncology is a rapidly evolving field comprised of multidisciplinary care teams focused on improving the outcome of patients with cancer.&nbsp;The purpose of this conference is to provide a state-of-the-art, comprehensive, case-based curriculum that addresses important clinical topics relevant to the cardiovascular health of patients with cancer. Clinical experts from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and around the country will present an up-to-date overview on cutting edge cancer therapies and best practice strategies in cardiovascular care in cancer patients including preventive strategies, early diagnosis and treatment and long-term surveillance. All presentations will include devoted time for interaction between audience members and presenters.Optional Networking Reception (Friday)Course attendees are invited to a networking reception on Friday evening, which will provide an opportunity to meet and interact with the course faculty and get to know other members in the cardio-oncology community. Please RSVP for the reception during course registration.&nbsp;Optional Computer Based Learning Lab (Saturday)There will be an optional computer-based session following the completion of the 2019 Cardio-Oncology Symposium, which will provide participants a personalized hands-on experience in Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) performance and analysis.

Therapy continues to evolve in multiple directions. Topics including inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis C, among others, see approvals of multiple important new medications every year. The line between the traditional realms of endoscopy and surgery also continues to blur and&nbsp;it is critical for both gastroenterologists and surgeons to explore these boundaries – this includes topics like the endoscopic approaches to treating Barrett's esophagus, and biliary disease, which in the past were relegated to a surgical approach, all of which will be covered in this course.To maintain their practices, gastroenterologists,&nbsp;surgeons and advanced practitioners need to stay up to date on a wide range of topics, including diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, understanding medical and surgical treatment strategies to chronic pancreatitis, managing colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver, and evaluating the side effect profiles of different biologic agents used in the management of inflammatory bowel disease&nbsp;.&nbsp;It is difficult for practicing physicians and surgeons to stay abreast of these new advances. The 37th Annual Medical and Surgical Gastroenterology Conference will provide a learning opportunity for participants in various GI disorders including the approach to the patient with suspected hereditary colon cancer, the calculus&nbsp;behind operating for arcuate ligament syndrome, and advances in robotic surgery for gastrointestinal disease. &nbsp;This year we are&nbsp;also&nbsp;returning back to basics, blending in an overview of management of hernias,&nbsp;acute cholecystitis and appendicitis, IBD for the non-IBDologist, and fatty liver disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also continue to have a full day of interactive&nbsp;case presentations and attendees have the opportunity to earn maintenance of certification (MOC) points.
